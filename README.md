In the web application 
Step 1:- i created a database user_profile which contain columns as name,age,mail,dob to store the details given by end user in my web form
Step 2-: i took index.html as a front view of my form ..it will show user to enter their name,email,age,date of birth.

Step 4:-  in userprofileservlet.java class  we made a web server connection with our html form by apache tomcat api
step 5:- in dbconnection.java class i made a connection of web form and java application so that all the values enter by user can be stored to my user_profile database
